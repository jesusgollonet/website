# JGW cli tool

A cli utility to interact with my blog/website. It allows to create, list, ~~delete~~ ~~edit~~ posts.

### Development

It's developed using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).

In order to be able to call the jgw command globally, you need to link it from
the global scope

```
yarn link --global
```

When developing, it's convenient to start tsc in watch mode

```
yarn tsc --watch
```
