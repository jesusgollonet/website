Ok let's get this published on ~~the Monday~~ Tuesday.

So now I have a problem, whenever I go to a skatepark, I have to choose between
the skateboard and bike. So far I've been basically splitting the time based on
what I feel like doing, often switching every 20 minutes. Trying to progress on
both is going to make it slower but oh well. 

Been early to a public skatepark a couple of mornings, setting up the tripod and
sessioning some things. I've already spotted a couple of bad habits from that
(rotated shoulders when ollieing, butt not back enough on manuals on the
bike...), so plan to do it more.  

I'm also looking for fun ways to put those into mini edits. The idea is similar
to what I'm doing here. Capture quickly, edit so that it's not super boring and
always publish. 

Here's one: https://www.instagram.com/p/CsjGAF3Is2L/

Inspired by [the daily push flick analysis
videos](https://www.instagram.com/p/CsEcOPjNfix/) I started researching better
ways to do video analysis, and daydreaming about automating / AI-ing some parts
of the process. Maybe

On the workout front, Yoga continues, and I started doing 5 minutes of jump rope
(which I've stopped for a few days as I hurt my knee on Sunday). I'm listening
again to the [Huberman and Andy Galpin Fitness assessment
episode](https://hubermanlab.com/dr-andy-galpin-how-to-assess-improve-all-aspects-of-your-fitness/)
and plan on doing some assessment this week.

I think that's mostly it, skating, recording and doing informal analysis, and
obsessing over fitness.
