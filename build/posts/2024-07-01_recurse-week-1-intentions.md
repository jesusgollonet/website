It's the First day of my batch today. We ~haven't had the kickoff meeting yet~ but
I'm taking some time to set intentions for the week. 

This week is inevitably dedicated to figuring things out, and I don't think I
should expect to get a lot of programming done, but I do still want to set some
goals.

- Figure out the shape of my days: I'm 6 hours ahead NY time, so core hours fall
between 5-11pm. Can I get some work done in the morning? How can I ensure I'm
productive in the evening? How do other remote recurses do it?

- Figure out the shape of the full batch. I have some project ideas, but I'm
going back and forth between depth and breadth. I'm hoping that after intro chats 
and meeting other recurses this week I'll have a better idea of what's possible
/ realistic.

- I would still like to get some small project done. A big explicit goal for me is
to build shipping muscle, meaning once I set out to do something, finish it,
write about it and present it. I would like to have something small and
presentable by the end of the week.


A couple of meta concerns I have:

- How can i make sure I get a healthy amount of movement in? Given the timezone
difference, I won't get a lot of time to skate/surf/bmx in the next 6 weeks.
I've grabbed a jump rope, yoga mat and some resistance bands to make sure I get
some workouts during the day. 

- What's a good ratio of blogging to coding? I want to use blogging as an
accountability method, but I know how easy it is to spend way too long on a
piece of writing... 

On that note, piece of writing done. Time to get to work.
