Ever since Cursor came out, I started low-key counting the days until I had to
switch away from vim / tmux. I took as a given that the productivity gains from an AI
powered editor would be too great to ignore, and started to see my insistence on
being terminal based as a my own little fun eccentric trait that would finally be gone soon... 

And then agentic coding tools have taken an unexpected turn: The best ones are
terminal based and unixy. And at least in the case of Claude Code, for the same
reasons that initially drove me to the terminal:

> 'So small and so flexible that it fits any workflow'

> 'The thinnest possible layer on top of the model'

Both phrases I've heard from the creator. 

I have been using it heavily in the last month: Initially i trialed it for prototypes and PoCs
at work, then making progress on personal projects that have been stuck for years in some cases,
but I can't stop finding new uses:

- Clicking around too much in the AWS console? Wait there's the aws-cli!
- Debugging github actions? gh cli to the rescue
- That thing i dread to do every 3 months where i have to duplicate 12 
page documents and replace a few values? CC can figure out the binary format and
replace it for me. 

It's unlocking so many venues to explore that I had previously dismissed as too
tedious or too much work to do I just can't stop. I'm not surprised to hear
the terms [Slot Machine and Addiction](https://madhavajay.com/agentic-coding-slot-machines-did-we-just-summon-a-genie-addiction/)
and [Sleep Problems](https://vimeo.com/1098025052)
thrown in the same sentence as agentic engineering, 

The double twist is that now the editor matters significantly less, as I'm using
it less and less. Maybe I can even look at vs-code. I don't really care.
