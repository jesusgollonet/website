I had to chuckle at this:

> ...you really can drive to the skatepark and itâ€™s like a gym

> ...you primarily have skateboarders who come from homes where their parents would drive them to a sporting environment.

From this [interview with Ben
Koppl](https://www.skateism.com/ben-koppl-hates-being-famous-online/), my
favorite skater which unsurprisingly seems to be an interesting person. He's
talking about the changing demographics of skateboarding. 

I feel strongly that treating skateboarding more like a regular sport is a
great thing (it's the reason why I'm even considering it at 46!), and I'm 100% a
parent that drives his kids to the skatepark, but I love his point about
skateboarding starting as a mode of transportation, and a way for kids that have
nothing else to do or want to avoid their neighbourhood to have a tool to do
that while pushng their creativity...

The full interview is interesting, I enjoyed his non-negative take on kids
perferring short instagram clips vs video parts (which I've often seen mourned
about in BMX circles), and the early youtube days.
