The hardest part of exercising is getting back to it once you inevitably fall off
the wagon. 

I started the year on a good streak of almost 2 months doing
reasonably regular exercise, including 2 to 3 days a week of strength and
at least one of low HR cardio. But then I got a new job, a stressful first
project and some other life events. So it's been a couple of months off again.

I have not completely stopped moving. I've been hitting the skatepark [on
a BMX with my kids](https://www.instagram.com/p/CrftUXQIhgZ/) almost every week, but as I'm learning, the consistency
and focus of an actual workout is the key to improving, especially well into your 40s \*.

There's the part where you need to get motivated enough to start again, but even
harder is the part where you need to re-adjust your expectations. You
were able to do X pull-ups, run Y kilometers, and now it's less. 

So I've started with low expectations. 20 minutes of yoga every day for a week.
I need to work on a bit of low back pain and just get mobility in order, then
I'll get back to strength and cardio.  

This is day 3. ðŸ¤ž
