For the next 8 weeks, I'm going to follow an extremely minimal strength training
plan of 4 exercises:

1. Pull ups
2. Split squats 
3. Push ups
4. Step ups

I'm going to do 3 sets for each, pairing 1-2 and 3-4. The number of reps is
still being figured out (I'm 2 weeks in), but anywhere from 5 to 15, depending
on the exercise. Since I don't have weights at home, I'll increase the rep range
by 5-10% per week.

In total I'm aiming to being done in under 25 minutes, including 5 min warmup,
and if there's any time left I'll do a jump rope finisher.

This is extremely small and and simple. And even though the exercises are
reasonably full body, it no doubt leaves stuff on the table. The
reasons why I still think it's worth comitting to are:

- I still need to make training a habit. I've started many times but there's
always something that gets me back to the starting line.  This is small enough
that I can't say no to under almost any circumstance.
- I need to build basic strength before getting into fancier exercises. There's
no shortage of Skate/Surf specific content on instagram and youtube, but after
trying a few things, it's clear to me that I need a solid foundation.
- As a fulltime working dad, that also wants to skate and BMX and surf (and many
other things!), I need to be extremely smart with time management.
- It can't interfere with random bmx/skate sessions throughout the week. There's
nothing more frustrating than not being able to do your sport because you're too
sore from training.
- I don't want to rely on a gym. Apart from pull ups. The rest of
exercises can literally be done anywhere.
- Having fewer exercises and low volume should allow me to focus on movement
quality.
- Any plan is better than no plan, and this is mine.
