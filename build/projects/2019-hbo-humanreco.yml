name: HBO Recommended By Humans

year: 2019
overview: | 
  I built a system to collect and display social recommendations for HBO shows. 
  It had three main parts: a crawler that monitored Twitter for mentions of HBO shows, 
  an automated tagger that used natural language processing to categorize these mentions, 
  and a content management system where HBO staff could review and publish the best recommendations.
sections:
  - title: Twitter Crawler 
    details: | 
      The twitter crawler was consuming the twitter api based on predefined keywords and mentions.
      It was implemented as a scheduled Lambda function that would then feed the content into an SQS queue.
  - title: Content Annotation
    details: |
      The content from the queue was then processed by an additional lambda function for sentiment analysis, categorization and simple moderation.
      The results were then stored in a DynamoDB table for further processing.
  - title: CMS Integration
    details: |
      The processed content would then be fed into a Contentful CMS for the HBO team to curate and eventually publish on the site
