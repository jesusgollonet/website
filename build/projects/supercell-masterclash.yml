  Led technical development and implemented the backend of this
  web application that transforms audio input into generative art
  pieces. I created the rendering pipeline that turns them into shareable assets
  and high resolution posters.

  - title: GPU-accelerated Rendering Environment 
    details: | 
        In order to leverage the rendering work on the frontend, I created a server-based rendering environment.
        using a headless browser on a GPU accelerated AWS instance. This allowed us to reuse the frontend rendering without any modifications 
  - title: High-Resolution Output Pipeline
    details: |
        Designed client-server architecture for high-resolution image generation, as well as created JSON-based state system for artwork parameters
